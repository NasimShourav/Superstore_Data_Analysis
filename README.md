This project analyzed a superstore's four years of sales data in the USA. The analysis helps to identify the key points such as total sales, total profit, the profit margin, the highest selling product, which category and sub-category generate the most revenue, which states and cities incurred the highest losses, which quarter generates the most revenue, most loyal customer, etc. 

The analysis was done following the six steps of data analysis, Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The original dataset was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final). Before analyzing, the data were cleaned following various data cleansing steps. Finally, the analyzed data was shared in Tableau for visual interpretation. (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nasim.al.goni/viz/SuperstoreSalesData_17042475888240/Dashboard10)
